TODO for 1.0
============
* Bug: markers can cause autoscaled axes to include [0, 1]
* Enh: rework subplot management:
        - X-axis labels and vertical spacing when using non-shared axes
* New: Relative / rezero'ed time axis
* New: Axes labels (mostly y-axis, but also others)
* New: API docs and examples
* Enh: relative paths in project files (introduce File Dependency object for Panels)
* Enh: reduce number of digits in FloatEditors
* Bug: zoom to fit / autoscale doesn't work for Camera Images

Unprioritized
=============
* New: Camera multi-image-mode for a single frame
* Portable project files. Possibly 'Bloated project' containing all data files.
* click in time graph and jump to camera image (single mode)
* Camera: cursor should show time instead of pixels in single frame mode
* Data export? How? Where? Why? When? Whatfor? Whatever! :)
* Camera: show frame metadata somehow
* Camera: show colorbar
* Camera: manual color scale?
* Camera: link Camera-Trend to Camera instance
* Camera: add file chaining support to panel
* Camera: improve performance when changing frames (update instead of complete rebuild)
* CameraTrend: option to not link datapoints of different frames
* Generalize DoubleMultiTrend to an arbitrary number of subplots (with or without twinx'ed graphs).
* Native Mac OS X package
* QMS: correct for fragmentation factors and ionization probabilities
* Separate concept of Plot and Canvas: multi canvas plots (dual-plot/semi-clone presentation mode)
* Two (or more) phase Panels: Initialization phase (no graph yet: select file and essential parameters for reading/interpreting), Plotting phase (any change is live!)
* Dual-plot/semi-clone presentation mode!
* Open frame in external editor (link to WSxM/Gwyddion/Camera)
* General raster-image plotting (or even Gwyddion file modules? Timestamp selection based on: exif, Gwyddion metadata field, filename pattern matching, filename datestamp)

Known bugs / limitations in the Enthought Traits UI toolkit
===========================================================
* when selecting items in a ListStrEditor using SHIFT instead of CONTROL, the 'selected' trait isn't updated properly
   (see also: https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/changeset?reponame=&old=19115%40TraitsBackendWX/trunk/enthought/traits&new=19161%40TraitsBackendWX/trunk/enthought/traits)
* ListStrEditor editable=False is not honoured (GTK only? works fine on Windows)
* Dragging text in TimeEditor could make a big mess
* Deselecting all items in a ListrStrEditor is not propagated to the 'selected' trait
