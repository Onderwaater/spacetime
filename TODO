TODO for 1.0
============
ESSENTIAL:
2. Enh: Delayed redraw / redraw on idle
3. Bug: cursor position with twinx'ed graphs
4. Enh: rework subplot management:
         - Subplot size hinting
         - X-axis labels and vertical spacing when using non-shared axes
5. New: Relative / rezero'ed time axis
6. New: Smart legend positioning: outside graphs, multicolumn, ... 

POLISHING:
1. Enh: Interface redesign: decide what to do with the Main tab
2. New: Icon
3. Enh: Auto-detection of modules.
4. Enh: Descriptions in Add subplot dialog
5. New: API docs and examples
6. Enh: Save/open/export dialogs should remember path
7. New: Subgraph manager (reorder graphs)
8. New: Axes labels (mostly y-axis, but also others)
9. New: More filters for Camera images (differential)
10. New: Camera multi-image-mode for a single frame


Low priority
============
* click in time graph and jump to camera image (single mode)
* Camera: cursor should show time instead of pixels in single frame mode
* Data export? How? Where? Why? When? Whatfor? Whatever! :)
* Camera: show frame metadata somehow
* Camera: show colorbar
* Camera: manual color scale?
* Camera: link Camera-Trend to Camera instance
* Camera: add file chaining support to panel
* Camera: improve performance when changing frames (update instead of complete rebuild)
* CameraTrend: option to not link datapoints of different frames
* Generalize DoubleMultiTrend to an arbitrary number of subplots (with or without twinx'ed graphs).
* Native Mac OS X package
* Fix CV support again

KNOWN BUGS (not my fault! :)
* when selecting items in a ListStrEditor using SHIFT instead of CONTROL, the 'selected' trait isn't updated properly

* ListStrEditor editable=False is not honoured (GTK only? works fine on Windows)
* Dragging text in TimeEditor could make a big mess
