High priority
=============
1. Subplot size hinting
2. Better autoscale
3. Interface redesign:
   - get rid of matplotlib toolbar
   - decide what to do with the Main tab
4. Finish open/save support: ListStr bugs, header for fileformat, ...
5. Bug: cursor position with twinx'ed graphs
6. X-axis labels and vertical spacing when using non-shared axes

Low priority
============
* L2R + R2L mode for CameraTrends
* click in time graph and jump to camera image (single mode)
* Camera: cursor should show time instead of pixels in single frame mode
* Data export? How? Where? Why? When? Whatfor? Whatever! :)
* Restructure: plugins dir with one file per "measurement type": camera.py, qms.py, gascab.py, tpdirk.py. Think about auto-detection of plugins.
* Camera: show frame metadata somehow
* Camera: show colorbar
* Camera: manual color scale?
* Camera: link Camera-Trend to Camera instance
* Camera: add file chaining support to panel
* Camera: improve performance when changing frames (update instead of complete rebuild)
* Icon
* CameraTrend: option to not link datapoints of different frames
* Presentation / dual screen mode: separate windows for graph and configuration

KNOWN BUGS (not my fault! :)
* when selecting items in a ListStrEditor using SHIFT instead of CONTROL, the 'selected' trait isn't updated properly
   (see also: https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/changeset?reponame=&old=19115%40TraitsBackendWX/trunk/enthought/traits&new=19161%40TraitsBackendWX/trunk/enthought/traits)
* ListStrEditor editable=False is not honoured (GTK only? works fine on Windows)
* time selector (x-axis limits) shows 12-hour clock
