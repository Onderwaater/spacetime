TODO for next release
=====================
* Enhance raster image support 
   - allow for manual file selection

Unprioritized TODO's:
=====================

Plotting / presentation
-----------------------
* Option for markers to hide data in future
* Bug: markers can cause autoscaled axes to include [0, 1]
* Reduce number of digits in FloatEditors
* Axes labels (mostly y-axis, but also others)
* Editable channel names
* Multi-image-mode for multi-channel images
* Interactive reverse markers: click in time graph and jump to image
* Colorbar for false color images
* Support non-uniformly spaced Time2D datasets (through pcolorfast)
* Custom cursor text for Images (value for false color plots, RGB for raster images; also time for scanning images)
* Preview size/resolution for export image/movie
* Remember settings for movie export
* Scalebars for images

Code structure:
---------------
* Separate concept of Plot and Canvas: multi canvas plots (dual-plot/semi-clone presentation mode)
* Relative paths in project files (introduce File Dependency object for Panels). Possibly 'Bloated project' containing all data files.
* Multi-file support for most subplots (auto chaining)
* Generalize DoubleMultiTrend to an arbitrary number of subplots (with or without twinx'ed graphs).
* Enh: rework subplot management:
        - X-axis labels and vertical spacing when using non-shared axes
* New: API docs and examples

Other:
------
* Gwyddion Image module (like general raster images, but somehow using the Gwyddion file modules)
* Movie import for raster image module
* Open frame in external editor (link to WSxM/Gwyddion/Camera)
* Enhance mass spec tricks (fragmentation factors & ionization probabilities)

Packaging:
----------
* Native Mac OS X package
* .deb package for Debian-based Linux distributions

LPM Camera related:
-------------------
* Camera: show frame metadata: select fields to show next to image and/or separate window with everything 
* Camera: real units in color scale
* Camera: link Camera-Trend to Camera instance
* Camera: improve performance when changing frames (update instead of complete rebuild)
* CameraTrend: option to not link datapoints of different frames
* Support for ScanDocuments, possibly also for projects


Known bugs / limitations in the Enthought Traits UI toolkit
===========================================================
* when selecting items in a ListStrEditor using SHIFT instead of CONTROL, the 'selected' trait isn't updated properly
   (see also: https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/changeset?reponame=&old=19115%40TraitsBackendWX/trunk/enthought/traits&new=19161%40TraitsBackendWX/trunk/enthought/traits)
* ListStrEditor editable=False is not honoured (GTK only? works fine on Windows)
* Dragging text in TimeEditor could make a big mess
* Deselecting all items in a ListrStrEditor is not propagated to the 'selected' trait
