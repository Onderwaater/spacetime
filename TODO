1. Subplot size hinting
2. Graceful/explicit errors (especially when loading file)
3. Better autoscale
4. Reload/refresh option for most filetypes
5. Interface redesign:
   - menubar or toolbar; matplotlib toolbar integrated
   - python shell only on demand and in separate window
   - better location for the status/cursor text
6. Project open/save

Non-prioritized items:
* click in time graph and jump to camera image (single mode)
* Camera: cursor should show time instead of pixels in single frame mode
* Data export? How? Where? Why? When? Whatfor? Whatever! :)
* Restructure: plugins dir with one file per "measurement type": camera.py, qms.py, gascab.py, tpdirk.py. Think about auto-detection of plugins.
* Camera: show frame metadata somehow
* Camera: show colorbar
* Camera: manual color scale?
* Camera: link Camera-Trend to Camera instance
* Camera: add file chaining support to panel
* Camera: improve performance when changing frames (update instead of complete rebuild)
* Icon

KNOWN BUGS (not my fault! :)
* when selecting items in a ListStrEditor using SHIFT instead of CONTROL, the 'selected' trait isn't updated properly
* time selector (x-axis limits) shows 12-hour clock
